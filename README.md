# üåø ESP32 Smart Irrigation System

An automated smart irrigation system built on the ESP32 microcontroller. This project integrates a Flutter mobile application to control watering, monitor sensor data, and display real-time weather information.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Automated Watering:** The ESP32 reads real-time data from soil moisture and temperature sensors to automatically trigger irrigation.
* **Mobile Control:** A full-stack Flutter application provides remote control to manually start or stop watering.
* **Real-time Monitoring:** View live soil moisture, temperature, and other sensor data directly from the mobile app.
* **Live Weather Updates:** The application displays current weather conditions and forecasts to help optimize irrigation schedules.
* **Efficient Resource Usage:** The system conserves water by only irrigating when necessary, based on environmental conditions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Hardware:**
    * ESP32 Microcontroller
    * Soil Moisture Sensor
    * Temperature Sensor (e.g., DHT11)
    * Water Pump
    * Transistor/Relay Module
    * Breadboard and jumper wires
* **Software:**
    * Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
    * Flutter SDK

### ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Setup

1.  **Connect the sensors:** Wire the soil moisture and temperature sensors to the ESP32 according to the provided schematics.
2.  **Connect the pump:** Connect the water pump to the ESP32 via a transistor or relay module to control the power supply.
3.  **Power:** Power the ESP32 and the pump using a suitable power source.

### üíª Software Setup

#### 1. ESP32 Code

1.  Open the `ESP32_code/ESP32_code.ino` file in your Arduino IDE.
2.  Configure your Wi-Fi credentials and Firebase settings in the code.
3.  Upload the code to your ESP32 board.

#### 2. Flutter Application

1.  Navigate to the `flutter_code` directory.
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
3.  Run the application on a connected device or emulator:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
4.  Follow the on-screen instructions to connect to your ESP32.
